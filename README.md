# Genetic Algorithms for Function Optimization

In this coding assignment, you will be using the Genetic Algorithms for Function Optimization.

Function optimization is when you find the optimum point of a function, either minimum or maximum. You will be creating a Genetic Algorithm to find the maximum point of this function:

$$
f(x, y) = (1 - x)^{2} \cdot e^{-x^{2} - (y + 1)^{2}} - (x - x^{3} - y^{3}) \cdot e^{-x^{2}-y^{2}}
$$

f(x, y) = (1 - x)^2 * e^(-x^2 - (y + 1)^2) - (x - x^3 - y^3) * e^(-x^2 - y^2)

where parameters x and y are between -2 and 2. Use a Genetic Algorithm with the population size of 8, the crossover probability of 0.7, and the mutation probability of 0.01. Use total number of generation as 200.

Your code should find the ( (x,y) ) pair that gives the maximum point and its fitness value ( f(x,y). )

For more information on this problem and the Genetic Algorithms, please see attached PowerPoint slides 14 to 35.
